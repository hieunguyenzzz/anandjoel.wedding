        en: "### When should we arrive in Vietnam?\n\nWe suggest sometime during the week of the wedding, maybe 3 – 4 days prior to the wedding date to get over jet lag.\_\n\n### Will the ceremony, and reception take place indoors or outdoors?\n\nOutdoors, so please plan accordingly. The temperature in December is usually cool ranging from 20 –\_ 26 Celsius (60 – 72 Fahrenheit).\_\n\n### Since the ceremony takes place at the Tree of Life and the reception at the Tree of Knowledge, how can we travel there?\n\nShuttle buses will be provided between the two venues. And also from and to the airport.\n\n### Can I take photos during the ceremony?\n\nWe will have a professional photography team at the wedding but if you want to snap some memories of our special weekend, we kindly ask that you keep photos to a minimum at the ceremony.\n\n### Is it ok to bargain pricing and if so, when/where?\n\nIt may come as a culture shock to some but bargaining in Vietnam for any type of goods is commonplace. Bartering comes down to fine art. This is mainly in the markets (unless there are signs that say fixed price). May the odds forever be in your favor!\n\n### What is the tipping culture in Vietnam?\n\nTipping isn’t mandatory or customary in Vietnam, but it is always appreciated. If you’re happy with the services provided by waiters, drivers and other service workers, leaving a small tip is a good way to show your appreciation. We recommend 10% as a ballpark.\n\n### How do things normally cost in Vietnam?\n\n\_\n\nFor accommodation, a 4-star hotel or above, on average, is $200/day. Food & drinks will be $100/day on average if you want to try a lot of different things (street foods / desserts / restaurants / coffee shops / etc.). If you go to clubs or some cool events or concert/rave or go to bars, it will be $200 – $500 for a week or so.\n\n### Are children allowed at the ceremony?\n\n\_\n\nDue to small venue and limitation, children age 12 or below are not allowed at the ceremony.\n\n### What food will be served at the reception?\n\n\_\n\nWestern food with Vietnamese influence.\n"
