          ### FLIGHT


          The cheapest and most efficient way to arrive in Vietnam is by booking
          a flight to Ho Chi Minh City and then taking a short domestic flight
          into Da Lat (about 30 mins). For those flying from the US, please note
          that the flight to Vietnam can be long (20-25 hours). Flights from NYC
          require at least one layover. We recommend choosing an itinerary with
          at least 2 - 2.5 hours of layover time to account for potential delays
          and allow for transfers between terminals, as some airports are large
          and may require additional security checks or luggage re-screenings.


          Some airlines we recommend are:


          \+ All Nippon Airways (ANA)


          \+ Asiana Airlines


          \+ Qatar Airline

        en: "### VISA INFO\n\nVietnam requires a visa for guests coming from the US. To qualify for\_ a Vietnamese Visa, your Passport needs to be valid for at least 6 months following your arrival date. However, visas are easy to obtain and Vietnam has fully opened its borders to all passengers, regardless of their vaccination status.\n\nDIY Visa: You can apply for Vietnam E-Visa online via the government website. The process is fairly simple, quick, and affordable. It takes approximately 3 days to process and costs $25. You can apply in the link below. Please remember to print out your visa and bring it with you. When you arrive in Vietnam, you'll simply walk through customs, show your Passport and E-Visa to the officer to receive your entrance stamp.\n\nFor an easier process you may want to have an agency process the visa on your behalf for an additional $25 ($50 total). You can also add a fasttrack option where at the airport an employee will help you through customs for an additional $70.

When entering SGN airport head to the Check-in counters then proceed upstairs to security. If you’re leaving in the morning security is generally quick and easy. We recommend getting to the airport at least an hour early to check in and get through security.\n\nOnce you arrive to Dalat, it takes approximately 45 minutes by taxi to arrive to the center of Da Lat. You may ask the driver for their contact info if you would like to continue using them throughout the trip.\_\n\n* **Traveling from Ho Chi Minh city to Da Lat by sleeper bus**\n\nIf you would like to experience traveling to Da Lat by road, you can try the sleeper bus. Buses\_ offer a few options such as private cabins, private beds, etc. It takes approximately 8 hours to travel from HCMC to Da Lat so we recommend taking the bus at night and arriving in the morning.

          the wedding day because you need to dress up). Most hotels offer
          laundry services, and prices change depending on the item and
          materials. We don’t recommend packing too many items. You will most

          The tale of An and Joel, unique as it is, beautifully illustrates the
          profound truth that love recognizes no boundaries – not vast
          distances, nor sky-high mountain ranges, nor the widest of rivers.
          It's the celestial dance of Duyên and of Bashert, a concept common to
          both the Jewish and Vietnamese cultures, a serendipity predestined by
