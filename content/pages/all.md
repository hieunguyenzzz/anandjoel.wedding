      - name: When should we arrive in Vietnam?
        en: "### When should we arrive in Vietnam?\n\nWe suggest sometime during the week of the wedding, maybe 3 – 4 days prior to the wedding date to get over jet lag.\_\n\n### Will the ceremony, and reception take place indoors or outdoors?\n\nOutdoors, so please plan accordingly. The temperature in December is usually cool ranging from 20 –\_ 26 Celsius (60 – 72 Fahrenheit).\_\n\n### Since the ceremony takes place at the Tree of Life and the reception at the Tree of Knowledge, how can we travel there?\n\nShuttle buses will be provided between the two venues. And also from and to the airport.\n\n### Can I take photos during the ceremony?\n\nWe will have a professional photography team at the wedding but if you want to snap some memories of our special weekend, we kindly ask that you keep photos to a minimum at the ceremony.\n\n### Is it ok to bargain pricing and if so, when/where?\n\nIt may come as a culture shock to some but bargaining in Vietnam for any type of goods is commonplace. Bartering comes down to fine art. This is mainly in the markets (unless there are signs that say fixed price). May the odds forever be in your favor!\n\n### What is the tipping culture in Vietnam?\n\nTipping isn’t mandatory or customary in Vietnam, but it is always appreciated. If you’re happy with the services provided by waiters, drivers and other service workers, leaving a small tip is a good way to show your appreciation. We recommend 10% as a ballpark.\n\n### How do things normally cost in Vietnam?\n\n\_\n\nFor accommodation, a 4-star hotel or above, on average, is $200/day. Food & drinks will be $100/day on average if you want to try a lot of different things (street foods / desserts / restaurants / coffee shops / etc.). If you go to clubs or some cool events or concert/rave or go to bars, it will be $200 – $500 for a week or so.\n\n### Are children allowed at the ceremony?\n\n\_\n\nDue to small venue and limitation, children age 12 or below are not allowed at the ceremony.\n\n### What food will be served at the reception?\n\n\_\n\nWestern food with Vietnamese influence.\n"

          Once upon a time in a small town, there was a mischievous cat named
          Whiskers. Whiskers had a peculiar habit of trying to catch the rays of
          sunlight that streamed through the windows. He'd leap and pounce at
          the rays, thinking they were playful creatures to chase.


          One sunny morning, Whiskers spotted a particularly bright ray of
          sunlight on the kitchen floor. He crouched low, wiggled his behind,
          and prepared for the pounce. Just as he sprang into the air, the ray
          of sunlight shifted, and Whiskers landed squarely in a bowl of pancake
          batter that was left out from breakfast.


          Now, Whiskers was not only covered in sticky pancake batter but also
          looked like a furry, white pancake himself. His eyes widened in
          surprise, and he tried to shake off the batter, but it only made
          things worse. He zoomed around the kitchen, leaving pancake-shaped paw
          prints everywhere.


          The commotion attracted the attention of the family, who burst into
          laughter at the sight of Whiskers, the pancake cat. They quickly
          grabbed their cameras and took photos of Whiskers as he tried to lick
          the batter off himself, making funny faces in the process.


          After a good laugh and a warm bath for Whiskers, the family couldn't
          stop sharing the story of their pancake-chasing cat with their
          friends. From that day on, Whiskers became famous in the neighborhood
          as the "Pancake Pouncer."


          And so, in this small town, every time someone made pancakes, they'd
          say, "Watch out for Whiskers! He might just mistake you for a
          sunbeam."
