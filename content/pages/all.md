    title: Questions & Answers
    fields:
      - name: content
        en: "### When should we arrive in Vietnam?\n\nWe suggest sometime during the week of the wedding, maybe 3 – 4 days prior to the wedding date to get over jet lag.\_\n\n### Will the ceremony, and reception take place indoors or outdoors?\n\nOutdoors, so please plan accordingly. The temperature in December is usually cool ranging from 20 –\_ 26 Celsius (60 – 72 Fahrenheit).\_\n\n### Since the ceremony takes place at the Tree of Life and the reception at the Tree of Knowledge, how can we travel there?\n\nShuttle buses will be provided between the two venues. And also from and to the airport.\n\n### Can I take photos during the ceremony?\n\nWe will have a professional photography team at the wedding but if you want to snap some memories of our special weekend, we kindly ask that you keep photos to a minimum at the ceremony.\n\n### Is it ok to bargain pricing and if so, when/where?\n\nIt may come as a culture shock to some but bargaining in Vietnam for any type of goods is commonplace. Bartering comes down to fine art. This is mainly in the markets (unless there are signs that say fixed price). May the odds forever be in your favor!\n\n### What is the tipping culture in Vietnam?\n\nTipping isn’t mandatory or customary in Vietnam, but it is always appreciated. If you’re happy with the services provided by waiters, drivers and other service workers, leaving a small tip is a good way to show your appreciation. We recommend 10% as a ballpark.\n\n### How do things normally cost in Vietnam?\n\n\_\n\nFor accommodation, a 4-star hotel or above, on average, is $200/day. Food & drinks will be $100/day on average if you want to try a lot of different things (street foods / desserts / restaurants / coffee shops / etc.). If you go to clubs or some cool events or concert/rave or go to bars, it will be $200 – $500 for a week or so.\n\n### Are children allowed at the ceremony?\n\n\_\n\nDue to small venue and limitation, children age 12 or below are not allowed at the ceremony.\n\n### What food will be served at the reception?\n\n\_\n\nWestern food with Vietnamese influence.\n\n### Where should I exchange money?\n\n\_\n\nIn Ho Chi Minh City:\n\n* EximBank Money Changer (135 Dong Khoi in District 1 of Ho Chi Minh City) is offering some of the best currency exchange rates in Saigon.\n* Money Changers at Tan Son Nhat Airport (SGN)\n\nIn Ha Noi City:\n\n* Money changers on Ha Trung St in the Old Quarter. You should compare the rate before exchanging money.\n* Ha Noi Money Exchange: 19B Hang Be, Hoan Kiem District, Ha Noi\n\n### Where should I rent a suit/ tuxedo?\n\n\_\n\nWe recommend Wedding Book at 583 Su Van Hanh st, Ward 3, District 10, HCMC to rent the qualified suit/ tuxedo.\n\n[Click here](https://www.weddingbook.vn)\n"

          ### FLIGHT


          If you are attending our wedding, we highly recommend booking a flight
          going into Ho Chi Minh City and then taking a short domestic flight
          into Da Lat (about 30 mins). Please note that the flight time from the
          USA to Vietnam can be long (20-25 hours with 1 layover). We recommend
          choosing tickets with at least 2 - 2.5 hours of layover time to
          account for potential delays and allow for transfers between
          terminals, as some airports are large and may require additional
          security checks or luggage re-screenings.


          Below are other airlines we recommend:


          \+ All Nippon Airways (ANA)


          \+ Asiana Airlines

          ### VISA INFO


          In order to receive a Vietnam Visa, your Passport needs to be valid
          for at least 6 months following your arrival date. Vietnam has fully
          opened its borders to all passengers, regardless of their vaccination
          status, and visas are now the only entry requirement into the country.


          Apply for Visa: About a month before you enter Vietnam, you'll want to
          apply for a Vietnam E-Visa. This is a simple and quick process that
          takes about 3 days and costs $25. You can apply in the link below.
          Enter for Vietnam: When you arrive in Vietnam, you'll simply walk
          through customs, show your Passport and E-Visa to receive your
          entrance stamp and walk right in.

          ### TRANSPORTATION


          1. Download GRAB app (similar to Uber) and link it to your card - it
          will make things a lot easier for you upon arrival.

          2. OR you can order a Taxi (it's pricier but negotiable).


          * Ho Chi Minh city - lots of Grab drivers, you can book one easily
          anywhere even from the airport.

          * Da Lat - hard to book a Grab driver, but there are lots of taxis
          outside the airport.
      - name: GOING TO DA LAT
        en: >
          #### GOING TO DA LAT


          \*Flying from Ho Chi Minh city to Da Lat


          Check-in counters then proceed upstairs to security. In the mornings,
          security is quick. We recommend getting to the airport at least an
          hour early to check in and get through security.


          45 minutes taxi ride from the airport to the center of Da Lat. There
          aren’t a lot of Grabs in the area, so we recommend getting the contact
          of your taxi driver from outside the airport. You will be able to call
          the driver directly and this will get you a better rate.


          \*Traveling from Ho Chi Minh city to Da Lat by sleeper bus


          If you want to experience traveling to Da Lat by road, you can try the
          sleeper bus with many more options such as private cabins, private
          beds, etc. It will take 8 hours to travel from HCMC to Da Lat so we
          recommend you take the bus at night to arrive in the morning.

          Here are some reputable sleeper bus brands:


          * [FUTA Bus Lines](https://futabus.vn/): A one-way trip is about
          300.000VND/pax (~$13/pax)

          * [Thanh Buoi](https://thanhbuoi.com.vn/tuyen-hcm-da-lat.html): A
          one-way trip is ranging from 290.000 - 440.000VND/pax (~$13 - $19/pax)
          with many options of seats (cabin/bed/chair)
      - name: MONEY
        en: >
          ### MONEY


          If you bring USD, in order to get the best exchange rate, it needs to
          be clean of new $100 bills, with no marks or small rips. Best place to
          exchange is at gold/jewelry stores. You can withdraw from ATMs however
          we’ve found it’s best to go inside a bank. The bank will require your
          passport and may charge a fee up to 4%, if your bank doesn’t reimburse
          these fees then your best bet is to bring USD.


          OR you can order VND $ from your bank prior to the trip.


          \*Some places do take debit/credit cards, but not all.
      - name: MEDICINE
        en: >
          ### MEDICINE


          If you have a weak immune system or weak stomach, then please pack
          medicine (book an appointment with your doctor to get a prescription
          beforehand).


          \*We typically bring Advil, Aquaphor (mosquito/ bug bites), Pepto
          Bismol, & Flu medicine!
      - name: DAILY TRAVEL BAG
        en: >
          ### DAILY TRAVEL BAG


          We recommend bringing a cross-body or fanny pack (none of that
          expensive stuff ladies & gents)! It's a very confident and safe place
          to store your wallet, passport and other items.


          Here are some items we carry in our fanny packs:


          * Passport

          * Money/ wallet

          * Chapstick and lotions (sunscreen)

          * Wipes and tissues!!! Hand wipes and napkins (you never know when
          you’ll need an emergency napkin)

          * Advil / small meds

          * AirPods or electronic accessories
      - name: TOILET
        en: >
          ### TOILET


          In Vietnam, most places do not use toilet paper (you can ask though).
          They use a bidet to clean after going. If you’re not comfortable with
          this, we highly suggest bringing toilet paper/ napkins/ tissues/ wipes
          in your daily bag. Depending on location, some toilets cannot handle
          toilet paper / paper products being flushed FYI. It’s recommended to
          use the spray & dry off with napkins / tissue you bring. There will be
          a small trash can to dispose of paper products.

          You should wear several layers of clothing to keep you warm and this
          also allows you to tuck away a few layers if you get hot. (Except on
          the wedding day because you need to dress up).


          Most hotels offer laundry services, and prices change depending on the
          item and materials. Try not to overpack, you will more than likely
          reuse outfits / buy new outfits.
